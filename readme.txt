As i am using the linux so i am sending you this file on how to run the code. Because in linux everything is different. 

First of all install python 3.10 or higher
https://python.org/downloads

Then in you command prompt run this command (Note: You must be inside the scraper folder.)
pip install poetry

After it run this command
poetry install

and then
poetry shell

After successfully running this command all of you dependencies are downloaded.

Then you can run the scraper
python main.py

This will start the scraper. You must not stop the scraper until its complete otherwise you have to start over.
